### Specifiy which type of charachter you want to use
    
  ##### You can specify which type of charchter or digit you want to use for generating the password like this.
      
      java -jar nipunpassgen.jar -10 -ttff.  
   (here t idicates true and f idicates false)
      
   as you can see we use a 2nd flag using some ttff--> 
   The 1st t indicates --> Using the lower case is true
   The 2nd t indicates --> Using the upper case is true
   The 3rd f indicates --> Using the Digit is false
   The 4th f indicates --> Using the Special char is false
      
   so as you can see this in generating the password we can specify the Type of charachter usage
